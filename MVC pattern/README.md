MVC - Model View Controller

The Model View Controller (MVC) design pattern specifies that an application consist of 
a data model, presentation information, and control information.

MVC is more of an architectural pattern, but not for complete application. 
MVC mostly relates to the UI / interaction layer of an application.

Here you'll find an example on how I applied this pattern by creating a simple calculator.
